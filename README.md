# TVTArtwork

This repository is intended as playground for graphics sounds and music to be incorporated into TVTower.

When using the web interface, open the appropriate folder and drag'n'drop a file.
If no appropriate folder exists, first create a readme file (e.g. animations/README.md).
This will create the folder, which then can be used for the contributions.
